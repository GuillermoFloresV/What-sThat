# What-sThat
A project that allows the user to choose or upload and image, and returns the image with boxes around objects it recognizes.


-----------------------------
In order to use this, you need to download this binary file:
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1o3TvjNBINHsBQC6VNSFs_Oghn47SIv9U/view?usp=sharing

Once downloaded, place it inside of your What-sThat/Flask/static/images   
folder


The current MVP is here in the object_detection.py file:
This file takes in a picture from your current working directory and then tries to find items inside of the picture.
**NOTE: In order for this to work, you still need the file provided above inside of your current working directory
